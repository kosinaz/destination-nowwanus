# The sequel of Destination: Pluto

After an observation interval of two to three months the discoverer is given an opportunity to propose a name.

Classical Kuiper belt objects are given mythological or mythic names (not necessarily from Greek or Roman mythology). Since 2019, names associated with creation (such as 50000 Quaoar) are encouraged though not required as they had been previously.

Arrokoth's name was chosen by the New Horizons team to represent the Powhatan people indigenous to the Tidewater region that includes the state of Maryland, where Arrokoth's discovery took place. In an old word list, arrokoth is glossed as 'sky', but it is more likely that it meant 'cloud'. he name 'Arrokoth' reflects the inspiration of looking to the skies, and wondering about the stars and worlds beyond our own

In 2026 New Horizons will fly by its second Kuiper Belt Object, 860626 Nowwanus, provisional designation KBO 2021 KD19. Nowwanus's name is also Powhatan, means lost. Represents the fact that this KBO wandered off from any imaginable orbit and was found by the New Horizons in 2021.

Before the official name, it was nicknamed Hr√≠mnir, the frost giant of the Norse mithology.

Other possible names were:

Ahone, the Powhatan god of creation.

Cuppenauk, gate, that represents the gate into the unknown, beyond the outer edge of the Kuiper belt.

Nussaandg, elder, that refers to the old age of the KBOs, and the wisdom they hold.

All from the old Powhatan word list from The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia.
